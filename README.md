EraCards is a flashcards Android app developed in Kotlin, designed to help users review content interactively through questions and answers. It has a simple interface with multiple screens (Activities) that guide the user from the beginning to the final score.

Using GitHub Actions in this project is important to automate the app build process, ensuring that every time a code change is made (push or pull request), the app is automatically compiled and tested. This helps identify bugs quickly, maintains code quality, and facilitates continuous integration, saving developers time and effort.
